This project was amazing journey to 3d graphics and it was so much fun to do it. I learned a lot 
and I tried to do this as well as possible and make it look good! Now I made project by trigonometry calculation but next time I am going to do this 
kind of thing with transformation matrix and I am waiting to learn that! This project was also a good lesson to structs and handeling data in bigger 
programs.
